Game name: "Oblivion's Gate"

Description: 
  "Oblivion's Gate" is a fast-paced 2D action game with a dark, apocalyptic theme. In a world on the edge of ruin, players battle through hordes of nightmarish enemies in a visually 
striking pixel art style reminiscent of Metal Slug. As the protagonist, you must fight your way to the ominous Oblivion's Gate, uncovering the secrets of a decaying world and 
confronting powerful bosses in your quest to stop the ultimate darkness from consuming everything.

  The world beyond the gate is a desolate and treacherous land, filled with the remnants of a once-great civilization now overrun by nightmarish creatures and malevolent forces. As 
the player, you must navigate through these hostile territories, uncovering lost knowledge, forging uneasy alliances, and battling otherworldly foes that seek to drag you into the abyss.
